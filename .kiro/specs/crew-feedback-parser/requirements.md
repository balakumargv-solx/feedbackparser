# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A batch processing system that uses LlamaIndex API to parse crew feedback forms (scanned documents or edited PDFs) and extract structured data to populate Excel spreadsheets. The system processes multiple files from a folder and extracts specific feedback metrics and crew information.

## Glossary

- **Feedback_Parser_System**: The automated system that processes crew feedback forms
- **LlamaIndex_API**: The cloud-based document parsing service used for text extraction
- **Crew_Feedback_Form**: Scanned or PDF documents containing crew safety and operational feedback
- **Excel_Output_File**: The spreadsheet file where extracted data is stored
- **Batch_Processing**: Processing multiple files in a single operation
- **Feedback_Metrics**: Numerical ratings (1-5 scale) for various safety and operational categories

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a maritime operations manager, I want to automatically process multiple crew feedback forms from a folder, so that I can efficiently extract and analyze crew feedback data without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is provided with a folder path containing feedback forms, THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL process all PDF and image files in the folder
2. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL use the LlamaIndex_API with scientific preset configuration for document parsing
3. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL extract vessel name, crew name, and crew rank from each form
4. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL extract all ten feedback metrics with their corresponding 1-5 ratings
5. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL extract the feature preference text or selection from each form

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the extracted feedback data to be automatically populated into an Excel file with proper structure, so that I can perform analysis and reporting on crew feedback trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL create or append data to an Excel file with predefined columns
2. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL populate each row with data from one feedback form
3. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL include columns for vessel, crew_name, crew_rank, all ten rating metrics, and feature_preference
4. WHEN a parsing error occurs for a specific file, THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL log the error and continue processing remaining files
5. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL provide a summary report of successfully processed files and any errors encountered

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the parsing system to handle authentication and error management properly, so that the system operates reliably in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL authenticate with LlamaIndex_API using the provided API key
2. WHEN API rate limits are encountered, THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
3. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL validate that required environment variables are set before processing
4. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL handle network timeouts and connection errors gracefully
5. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL provide detailed logging for debugging and monitoring purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maritime operations manager, I want the system to handle various document formats and quality levels, so that all crew feedback forms can be processed regardless of scanning quality or format variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL process both PDF and common image formats (PNG, JPG, TIFF)
2. WHEN text extraction confidence is low, THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL flag the record for manual review
3. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL attempt to parse partially readable documents and extract available data
4. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL handle forms with different layouts or slight format variations
5. THE Feedback_Parser_System SHALL provide data quality indicators for each extracted record
